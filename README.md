# 🐍 fun-with-python

Welcome to **fun-with-python**! 🚀

A collection of Python experiments, learning exercises, and fun challenges. This repository is all about exploring Python’s power, having fun, and studying new concepts as a programmer—not just a developer. 😄

## ✨ Philosophy

🔹 **Just for fun and learning:** Every module here is a result of curiosity, experimentation, and the joy of programming in Python.

🔹 **Study-focused:** The repository is a playground for trying out Python features, patterns, and libraries. Each module (like `python-logging` or `python-unittest`) has its own README and sometimes a NOTE.md to share what was learned.

🔹 **Modular structure:** Modules are organized with clear, C-like main entry points and file structures to make exploration easy.
